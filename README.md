# Grayscales-Visual-Novel-Engine
Welcome to the world of visual novel development!

My visual novel engine aims for simplicity for the user while having complete control on how it works.

# Installation
- Downlaod and install your preferred unity version(suggested version: 2020.1.2f1).
- Download the latest release from the releases page.
- Extract the .zip file in an empty folder preferably named after your project(e.g: Falling leaves of October).

# Usage
- Add the project in unity using the 'Add' button and navigating to your project files.
- Launch the project amd start by creating a new scene.
- Create a new empty game object and name it 'ScriptManager'.
- Put these scripts in it: DialogueManager, CGManager, CharacterInfo, ChapterManager, SaveLoadSystem, CharacterManager, JSONSentenceImporter(only add this one if you plan to import sentences using a JSON file).
- Create a new empty game object and name it 'SentenceManager'.
- In it, put the script 'SentenceManager' in it.
- Now, create a simple UI using the prefab given in the prefabs folder.
- Assign all the variables for the 'DialogueManager' script.
- Edit the choice and backlog prefabs to match your preference.

That's it! You're ready to create your own viaual novels! Good luck in your journey and if you have any problems figuring out the engine--
